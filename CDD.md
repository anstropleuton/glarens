## Checkpoints

- [ ] Fundamentals
    - [x] CMake setup
    - [x] Clang LSP setup
    - [x] Dummy files
    - [x] Property system (yoinked from my other project)
    - [x] Math framework (also yoinked from my other project)
    - [ ] SDL window setup
    - [ ] Render lines
    - [ ] Get input
    - [ ] Compile shaders
    - [ ] Render shaders
- [ ] Get node graph working
    - [ ] Indirection-based unidimensional array of nodes (no actual tree datastructure)
    - [ ] Layout system
    - [ ] Visualization (just color-coded lines)
    - [ ] Min/max clamping
    - [ ] Dynamic editing for testing purposes
    - [ ] Templating and syncing
    - [ ] Garbage collection to delete soft-deleted nodes
- [ ] Create shape shader
    - [ ] Point-based
    - [ ] Rounded corner
    - [ ] Distance from pixel to nearest edge
    - [ ] Units traveled from point to point
    - [ ] Customizability, perhaps using formatted shaders

    - [ ] literally same structure just upload to shader
- [ ] Render modern looking layouts
    - [ ] Hook shape system to node graph with component system
- [ ] Event handling nodes
    - [ ] Do they have to be nodes?
    - [ ] Keyboard & Mouse support
