    - [ ] Compile shaders
        - [ ] Precompile shaders using SDL_shadercross CLI
        - [ ] Livecompile shaders using SDL_shadercross API
    - [ ] Render shaders
        - [ ] Load SPIRV, MSL or DXIL depending on backend
        - [ ] Set shader uniforms
        - [ ] Display shader
- [ ] Get node graph working
    - [ ] Indirection-based unidimensional array of nodes (no actual tree datastructure)
    - [ ] Layout system
    - [ ] Visualization (just color-coded lines)
    - [ ] Min/max clamping
    - [ ] Dynamic editing for testing purposes
    - [ ] Templating and syncing
    - [ ] Garbage collection to delete soft-deleted nodes
